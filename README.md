Hey! this is a program I wrote during the summer of 2023. 
## Step 1: Install Necessary Libraries

Ensure that you have the following libraries installed:
```
- openai
- tkinter
- sounddevice
- numpy
- scipy
```

## Step 2: Obtain an OpenAI API Key

- Search for tutorials on YouTube on how to obtain an OpenAI API key if you're unsure about the process.
- **Important:** You will need a credit card to use this program. While OpenAI charges for their API usage, it's quite affordable. A single API call can cost less than a penny. 
- Check the detailed pricing for each model on [OpenAI Pricing](https://openai.com/pricing).

## Step 3: Run the Program

- Navigate to `main.py`
- put your api key into where it says "put api key here"
- If the program doesn't run as expected, verify that you've correctly installed the necessary libraries mentioned in Step 1.
